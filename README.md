# ResearchSimulator

This repository contains a single-page social work research simulation for MSW students. The experience walks learners through research design choices with coaching, practice prompts, and end-of-run reflections.

## What the simulator now includes
- A three-column story and dashboard experience with stage timeline, path history, and live metrics for ethics, rigor, time, budget, trust, and wellbeing.
- A lab grid with a persistent field notebook, readiness drills checklist, method reference, and new study charter selector to anchor runs around ethics, rigor, or delivery.
- A field events deck to inject realistic complications (e.g., data breaches, funding changes) and observe how tradeoffs shift.
- An action plan builder that translates low metrics into concrete, ready-to-try improvement steps.

## Why GitHub might show an older "Updated" time
GitHub displays "Updated" based on the timestamp of the most recent commit on the branch, not the moment you merge a pull request locally. If you merged without adding new commits or if your branch tip is unchanged from several hours ago, GitHub will continue to show that earlier time until a newer commit is pushed. Cached timestamps can also take a short while to refresh after syncing.
